Python-Repeated-Timer is an open-source & highly performing timer using only standard-libraries.

Users may change the `interval` and `duration` of the event as they wish.

This code is GUI freezing issue won't be happening, and performance of the timer won't be affected by any event.

## Features:
* Python Repeated Timer is a open-source library based on Thread Timer, and this asynchronously triggers the event every N seconds.

* For this only uses python standard-library, no additional library is required.
* Easy to implement by simply using functions such as start(), stop(). Also, this timer is stable on multiple calls.
* No matter how heavy timer_tick() is, the timer's interval & duration won't be affected.
* It is possible to insert the argument so you can customize the timer as you want.
* You may change the interval & duration of the timer.
* No freezing issue occurs with GUI libraries such as Tkinter.

## Install:
To install the current release:

```shell
$ pip install python-repeated-timer
```

## Usage:

If you want to use a repeated timer in a python code, see this [tutorials](https://github.com/takhyun12/python-repeated-timer/blob/main/usage.py)

```shell
$ python
```

``` python
>>> from repeated_timer import Repeated_Timer
>>> def timer_tick(remaining_time: int, *args: tuple, **kwargs: dict):
>>>   # You can put your code in here
>>>   print('timer tick!')
>>>   print(remaining_time)  # You can use remaining_time
>>>
>>> repeated_timer = Repeated_Timer(interval=1, duration=30, function=timer_tick, args1='args1')
>>> repeated_timer.start()
>>> # repeated_timer.stop()
```

## Usage for GUI(with TKinter)
